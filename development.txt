## High-Level Description of Inner Workings

A debug session follows these steps
 * Debug session begin or step
 * Request stack frames comes in
 * Request scopes for selected frame comes in (usually 0, the top frame, but can go up to n where n is the current stack frames depth).
 * Request variables for current open scopes comes in (scope reference is only fetched if > 0) If scope is different than 0, then we need to do a `dbup` or `dbdown` before fetching the variables.
 * Request child variables as needed (child variable ref > 0)

Funny fact, I noticed too late that the name of the plugin is not only spelled wrong but also it doesn't follow the expected "no caps and words separated by hyphens" pattern. :p

This was removed from the readme, as it's more for plugin developers and might confuse the plugin user.
